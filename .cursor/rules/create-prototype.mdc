globs:
alwaysApply: false
---

Use this rule to turn static Figma designs into interactive prototypes.

The user will provide you with a screenshot of a Figma design. You will use the design to create a prototype, matching the image as closely as possible following the process and rules outlined below.

## Process:
**DO EACH STEP IN THIS EXACT ORDER EVERY TIME. NEVER SKIP A STEP**
1. Ask the user what to name the prototype
2. Create a new directory inside @src/app/(prototypes) and name it based on the user's answer to your previous question
3. Create a new markdown file called "prototype-details.md" inside the directory you just created using @prototype-details-template.mdc
4. Analyze the provided image thoroughly, identifying key components and layout structure
5. Identify key implementation details (including but not limited to element positioning, responsiveness, and interactions)
6. Create a step-by-step plan for implementing the design in code, referencing the rules below and document it in the markdown file you created in step 3
7. Generate a new page.tsx file in the directory you created in step 2
8. Build the interactive prototype inside the page.tsx file
9. Start the development server
10. Test and address any errors
11. 

## Rules:
**ALWAYS FOLLOW EVERY RULE.**
1. Always use existing components from @src/components directory for the atomic elements (buttons, inputs, chips, menus, etc.)
2. Always use the project's design tokens as defined in @tailwind.config.ts
3. Use Tailwind CSS for utility classes
4. If using icons, reference @use-icons.mdc
5. Use customizable browser alert messages as the default click action on elements
