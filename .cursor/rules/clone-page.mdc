This rule is employed when a user wants to create a new page in this project's code base that matches their current product as closely as possible. They will attach a screenshot of the product to use as a reference.

Follow these steps when they ask you to create a new page:
1. Ask what they would like to name the page
2. Ask what their requirements are.
3. Create a directory for the page in the `src/app` directory and create a new file using the title they asked for.
4. Create a step-by-step plan for building the page based on the requirements and any reference screenshot.
5. Identify any new components that will need to be created that don't currently exist in the `/components` library.
6. Tell the user what your plan is, and ask if they want you to proceed.
7. If new components are needed, create them in the page file itself (do not create a separate file or add it to the `/components` directory).
8. Assemble the page for the screen they requested on the page using components from the `src/components` folder as well as any components you created in the page file already.
9.  Share the page with the user, along with instructions on how to adjust the component properties if needed.
10. Ask the user if they would like to extract any components you created into separate, reusable components. If they say yes, use [create-component.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/create-component.mdc) to set up the component (subtituting the design you've already created for the reference image usually required by that flow).

Be sure to follow all of these rules every time:
* Use any components from the project library that are needed for the page.
* When creating new components on the page, remember to use design tokens from [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts) and any existing components from the `/components` directory for things you may need, such as icons, typography, colors, buttons, inputs, etc.
* Use the design tokens defined in [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts) and the `src/app/theme` folder for all designs.
* Use Tailwind CSS, Next JS, and Typescript to create the page.
* DO NOT use any external libraries.
* If the user gives you images with inspiration, don't pay attention to their styling. Just look at them for big-picture layout, content, structure, and context.
* Use your best judgment to adjust the properties and variants used for each component in the design.
