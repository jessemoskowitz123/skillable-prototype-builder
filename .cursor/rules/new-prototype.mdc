This rule is used when a user wants to create a new prototype from the components in this project's component library.

Follow these steps when they ask you to create a new prototype:
1. Ask what they would like to name the prototype
2. Ask if there are any specific components from the library that they want you to use.
3. Ask if they have any specific examples or inspiration images they want you to use.
4. Once they've answered those questions, create a directory for the prototype in the `src/app` directory and create a new file using the title they asked for.
5. Create a prototype for the screen they requested on the page using components from the `src/components` folder.
6. Share the prototype with the user, along with instructions on how to adjust the component properties if needed.

When you're creating the prototype, be sure to follow all of these rules every time:
* Use any components requested by the user along with any other components from the project library that are needed for the prototype.
* If you think the prototype needs a component that doesn't currently exist, DO NOT CREATE IT. Instead, add a placeholder (light gray box) to the area of the screen where the component would go. Add text to the placeholder explaining what type of component you're envisioning.
* Use the design tokens defined in [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts) and the `src/app/theme` folder.
* Use Tailwind CSS, Next JS, and Typescript to create the prototype.
* DO NOT use any external libraries.
* If the user gives you images with inspiration, don't pay attention to their styling. Just look at them for big picture layout, content, structure, and context.
