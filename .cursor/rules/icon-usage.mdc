# How to use icons in this codebase

## Rules:
* Use Lucide icons for all icons in the project
* Do not import icons from Lucide anywhere except [Icon.tsx](mdc:src/components/Icon.tsx) 

## Instructions:
When a user asks for a component or design that requires icons, do the following:
1. Identify the type of icon needed
2. Check if that icon has already been imported to [Icon.tsx](mdc:src/components/Icon.tsx) 
3. If yes, use the existing icon
4. If no, determine which icon from the Lucide icon set would be most appropriate and import it into to [Icon.tsx](mdc:src/components/Icon.tsx) 
5. Use the new icon in your component or design
