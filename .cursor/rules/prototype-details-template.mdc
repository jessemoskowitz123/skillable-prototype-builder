Use this rule when writing markdown documentation files to accompany a new prototype.

All files should be written in markdown and saved as a markdown document(.md) in the same directory as the prototoype they document.

They should **ALWAYS** includ **ALL** of the following in this order:
* Descriptive title
* 1-2 sentence description
* Current date in MONTH DAY, YEAR format
* Description of the original design that was analyzed
* Step-by-step implementation plan with checkboxes generated as part of @create-prototype.mdc
* List of components from @src/components used in the prototype
* Performance considerations and optimization notes
* Bundle size impact (if any)
* Known limitations or areas for improvement
* Accessibility compliance notes
* Instructions for the user on how to make adjustments to the prototype
* Instructions for the user on how to make adjustments to the prototype
