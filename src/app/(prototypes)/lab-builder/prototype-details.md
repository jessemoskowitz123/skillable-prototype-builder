# Product-Led Growth Web App Prototype for Skillable

An interactive lab builder prototype that demonstrates Skillable's ability to create high-fidelity, hands-on technical labs through drag-and-drop functionality and lead capture.

**Current Date:** December 19, 2024

## Original Design Analysis

This prototype creates a modern, engaging web application that showcases Skillable's lab creation capabilities. The design features:

- **Flow-Based Lab Creation**: Step-by-step process from Build → Info Capture → Preview
- **Comprehensive Activity Bank**: 50 bite-sized activities (3-10 minutes each) with granular skills
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Visual activity bank with draggable components
- **Granular Skill Focus**: Each activity focuses on one specific skill (e.g., "Azure Resource Management", "React Hooks", "Docker Image Building")
- **Technology & Topic Tagging**: Activities tagged with 40+ technologies and 15+ topics
- **Lead Capture Flow**: Required form submission before lab preview access
- **Modern UI**: Clean, frictionless interface using existing design system components

## Implementation Plan

- [x] **Step 1**: Create prototype directory structure
- [x] **Step 2**: Create prototype documentation
- [x] **Step 3**: Analyze design requirements and component needs
- [x] **Step 4**: Check component availability and identify missing components
- [x] **Step 5**: Create implementation plan with performance considerations
- [x] **Step 6**: Generate page.tsx file with interactive prototype
- [x] **Step 7**: Implement drag-and-drop functionality
- [x] **Step 8**: Create activity bank with sample content
- [x] **Step 9**: Build lead capture form with validation
- [x] **Step 10**: Implement lab preview functionality
- [x] **Step 11**: Add technology and topic tagging system
- [x] **Step 12**: Integrate existing design system components
- [x] **Step 13**: Expand to 50 activities with granular skills
- [x] **Step 14**: Convert to flow-based experience
- [x] **Step 15**: Document final implementation

## Components Used

- **Buttons**: Button, SplitButton for actions and navigation
- **Cards**: DashboardCard for activity display
- **Inputs**: TextField, DropdownSelect for lead capture form
- **Info**: Chip for technology/topic tags, Alert for notifications
- **Navigation**: Tabs for different sections
- **UI**: LoadingSpinner, EmptyState for various states
- **Data**: DataTable for activity listing
- **Dialogs**: BasicDialog for confirmations
- **Icons**: Various Lucide icons for visual elements

## Performance Considerations

- **Drag-and-Drop**: Using HTML5 drag-and-drop API for optimal performance
- **State Management**: React.useState and useCallback for efficient re-renders
- **Lazy Loading**: Activities loaded on-demand to reduce initial bundle size
- **Memoization**: React.memo for activity components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Bundle Optimization**: Only importing necessary components to minimize bundle size

## Bundle Size Impact

- **Estimated Impact**: ~75KB additional (gzipped) - increased due to 50 activities
- **New Dependencies**: None - using existing components
- **Code Splitting**: Prototype isolated in separate route for optimal loading

## Known Limitations

- **Drag-and-Drop**: Limited to modern browsers with HTML5 support
- **AI Features**: Visual teasers only - no actual AI functionality
- **Data Persistence**: No backend - data stored in browser state only
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop - mobile drag-and-drop may need refinement

## Accessibility Compliance

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactive elements
- **Screen Reader**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
- **Color Contrast**: Using existing design system colors that meet WCAG standards
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order

## Instructions for Adjustments

### Adding New Activities
1. Edit the `sampleActivities` array in the page.tsx file
2. Add new activity objects with required properties (title, description, skill, technology, topic)
3. Include appropriate icons and difficulty levels

### Modifying Lead Capture Form
1. Update the form fields in the `LeadCaptureForm` component
2. Modify validation logic in the `handleSubmit` function
3. Adjust form styling using existing Tailwind classes

### Changing Technology/Topic Tags
1. Update the `technologies` and `topics` arrays in the page.tsx file
2. Modify the tag display logic in activity components
3. Update filtering functionality if needed

### Styling Adjustments
1. Use existing Tailwind utility classes for consistent styling
2. Modify component variants rather than creating new components
3. Follow the existing design system patterns for colors, spacing, and typography

## Instructions for User Adjustments

### Customizing Activity Content
- Edit the `sampleActivities` array to add/remove/modify activities
- Update skill associations, technology tags, and difficulty levels
- Modify activity descriptions and learning objectives

### Adjusting Form Fields
- Add/remove form fields in the lead capture component
- Update validation rules and error messages
- Modify the form submission logic

### Changing Visual Design
- Update color schemes using existing Tailwind classes
- Modify layout spacing and component arrangements
- Adjust typography using the design system's text utilities

### Adding New Features
- Extend the drag-and-drop functionality for more complex interactions
- Add new activity types or categories
- Implement additional preview modes or lab configurations
