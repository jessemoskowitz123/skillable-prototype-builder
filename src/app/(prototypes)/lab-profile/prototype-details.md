# Lab Profile Prototype

A comprehensive lab profile interface for Skillable Studio that displays detailed information about a lab including metadata, performance metrics, and management tools.

**Creation Date:** July 31, 2025

## Original Design Analysis

The design shows a sophisticated lab management interface with:
- Top navigation bar with Skillable Studio branding and user menu
- Secondary action bar with edit controls, dropdowns, and launch button
- Two-panel layout: left snapshot panel (30%) and right detailed panel (70%)
- Left panel contains lab status, title, description, and key metadata pairs
- Right panel features tabbed interface with performance metrics, details, skills, resources, and more
- Clean, modern design with green primary actions and purple skill tags

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Create directory structure for lab-profile prototype
- [x] Create prototype documentation
- [x] Analyze design components and layout structure
- [x] Verify component availability in design system
- [x] Create step-by-step implementation plan
- [x] Generate page.tsx file with basic structure
- [x] Implement PrimaryNav component integration
- [x] Create secondary action bar with edit buttons and dropdowns
- [x] Build left snapshot panel with lab metadata
- [x] Implement right panel with tabbed interface
- [x] Add performance metrics section
- [x] Create details section with lab information
- [x] Implement skills section with removable tags
- [x] Add resources section with cards
- [x] Create customized launch links section
- [x] Implement tags section
- [x] Add responsive design considerations
- [x] Test functionality and interactions
- [x] Optimize performance and accessibility
- [x] Document final implementation

## Components Used

### From @src/components:
- `PrimaryNav.tsx` - Main navigation bar
- `Button.tsx` - Edit profile, edit instructions, launch lab buttons
- `Chip.tsx` - Status indicators and skill tags
- `Tabs.tsx` - Tab navigation for different sections
- `Divider.tsx` - Visual separation between metadata sections
- `DropdownSelect.tsx` - Instruction set and theme dropdowns
- `Icon.tsx` - Various icons (star, more, chevron, etc.)
- `DataTable.tsx` - For displaying metadata in organized format

## Performance Considerations

- Used React.memo() for static components like metadata displays
- Implemented lazy loading for tab content to reduce initial bundle size
- Used useMemo() for expensive computations like performance calculations
- Optimized re-renders with proper state management
- Implemented proper loading states to prevent layout shifts

## Bundle Size Impact

- Minimal impact as all components are from existing design system
- No new external dependencies added
- Estimated bundle size increase: <50KB (gzipped)

## Known Limitations

- Mock data is used for demonstration purposes
- Some interactive features (like editing) show placeholder functionality
- Date formatting could be enhanced with proper localization
- Skill tag removal functionality is simulated

## Accessibility Compliance

- Proper ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support for tabs and dropdowns
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- Screen reader friendly structure with proper headings
- Focus management for modal interactions

## Making Adjustments

### To modify the layout:
1. Edit the main container classes in `page.tsx`
2. Adjust the flex basis for left/right panels (currently 30%/70%)
3. Update responsive breakpoints as needed

### To change the data:
1. Modify the mock data objects at the top of `page.tsx`
2. Update the metadata pairs in the left panel
3. Adjust performance metrics in the right panel

### To add new sections:
1. Add new tab content to the tabs array
2. Create corresponding content components
3. Update the tab navigation structure

### To customize styling:
1. Use existing design tokens from Tailwind config
2. Modify component variants in their respective files
3. Update color schemes using CSS custom properties

## Usage Instructions

1. Navigate to `/lab-profile` in your browser
2. The prototype will load with mock data
3. Test tab navigation between different sections
4. Try the dropdown interactions in the header
5. Verify responsive behavior on different screen sizes
